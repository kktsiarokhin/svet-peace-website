        <p>The Svet Peace Project (SPP) was founded on the belief that lasting peace begins with the ability to think, speak, and listen together. Our work grows out of regions marked by conflict‚ÄîRussia, Ukraine, Belarus, Armenia, and others‚Äîbut now extends to the United States, where civic division and distrust present a different, yet equally urgent, challenge.</p>

        <p>We believe that peacebuilding and education are inseparable. Drawing on the Socratic method and the classical curriculum, we create spaces for students to practice the habits of thoughtful dialogue: listening deeply, questioning openly, and reasoning with integrity. These are not only intellectual skills but civic ones‚Äîthe foundation of trust in any society.</p>

        <p>Our seminars follow a simple structure: no lectures, no ideology, only shared reading and conversation around great texts that still speak to the moral and political struggles of our time. Whether discussing Plato or Tolstoy, participants learn to seek clarity, welcome disagreement, and rediscover the courage to think for themselves while learning with others.</p>

        <p>While our early work centered on Eastern Europe and the wounds left by the Soviet legacy, we now bring the same approach to American classrooms and communities. The U.S. shapes civic discourse far beyond its borders; strengthening thoughtful dialogue here strengthens it everywhere. By fostering reflection, empathy, and a sense of shared human dignity, SPP remains grounded in its original mission‚Äîto advance peace through education that awakens the best in the human spirit.</p>
