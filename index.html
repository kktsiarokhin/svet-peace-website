      <h2>Why "Svet"</h2>
      <p>✨ Our name comes from the <em>Slavic word for <strong>"light"</strong></em> (a root shared among Slavic languages) — a symbol Leo Tolstoy often used to describe the quiet inner work that makes peace possible. As he writes in <em>War and Peace</em>:</p>
      
      <div class="media-highlight">
        <blockquote class="featured-quote">
          "He saw above him the high, eternal sky—unclear, yet infinitely deep and alive with light [svet]."
        </blockquote>
        <div class="quote-attribution">
          <span class="newspaper-credit">(War and Peace — Book III, Ch. 16)</span>
        </div>
      </div>
      
      <p>Leo Tolstoy's vision reminds us that <strong>true peace begins in the human heart</strong>.</p>
      
      <p>🌱 <strong>"Svet" is an invitation</strong>: to seek clarity, to listen honestly, and to let dialogue illuminate what divides us. We chose this name because our seminars aim to kindle that same light in young people.</p>
      
      <p>🕊️ Our work is shaped by the <a href="https://www.sjc.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">St. John's College</a> seminar tradition, described by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/11/opinion/contrarian-college-stjohns.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The New York Times</a> as "the most contrarian college in America", and inspired by the <a href="https://uwc.org/what-is-uwc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">UWC movement</a>'s vision of education for peace.</p>

              <p class="course-location">New York City</p>
              <p class="course-description">
                This course invites New York City high school students to read one short story per week (Chekhov, O'Connor, and others) and explore it together in an open, thoughtful atmosphere. Through attentive reading and careful listening, students practice small but essential habits that help prevent everyday misunderstandings from turning into real conflict.

              <p class="course-location">Española YMCA Teen Center, New Mexico</p>
              <p class="course-description">
                This course uses music and short video clips as an accessible entry point into dialogue for teens in Española. Many participants struggle with reading or sustained attention but respond strongly to sound, rhythm, and emotion. Each session begins with a song or short clip and opens into a guided Socratic conversation. Students practice listening carefully, expressing their thoughts, and staying with disagreement without shutting down. For many, this becomes a first experience of turning tension or frustration into understanding through dialogue.

              <p class="course-location">YouthWorks Teen Center, Santa Fe, New Mexico</p>
              <p class="course-description">
                This blended course is designed for teens with diverse and often challenging backgrounds, including students involved in the juvenile justice system. The course begins slowly and relationally, using simple statements, questions, and very short texts to build trust, attention, and confidence. Alongside dialogue, students work on practical life skills such as basic financial literacy, professional communication, and writing short emails. Readings are brief and read together in class, with difficulty increasing gradually as students gain confidence. Texts include short aphorisms and striking literary stories, such as Nietzsche's reflections on social roles and Hans Christian Andersen's unsettling fairy tales, chosen to invite honest and lively discussion.

              <p class="course-description">Through vivid voices of Russian literature, we explored how questions of beauty, morality, and human destiny are expressed in short form. In a group of students from Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus, these stories became shared ground for exploring the emotional and moral complexities of their region's conflicts. The course created a space where participants could examine painful histories and contemporary tensions through the lens of shared literary tradition, transforming division into dialogue.</p>

Because the group included students from countries shaped in different ways by the Soviet past, the course became a setting where participants could examine the historical complexities of today's tensions together. Through Socratic dialogue, students navigated conflicting narratives and competing interpretations of shared history, learning to hold multiple perspectives simultaneously.</p>

Students from Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus came together each week despite the war between their countries, building trust and understanding through Socratic dialogue. The course demonstrated that even in the midst of active conflict, young people can create spaces of honest conversation, using literature as a bridge across political and cultural divides.</p>

          <p>Kanstantsin grew up between Minsk, Belarus and Kyiv, Ukraine, where he absorbed the post-Soviet region's rich cultural complexity and political tensions. His path in education began early in Minsk, where he founded conversational English courses that brought together students from different backgrounds — an experience that shaped his commitment to accessible and dialogical learning.

After relocating to Berlin in 2022, he achieved fluency in German and immersed himself in European intellectual traditions before completing his undergraduate studies at St. John's College. Now based in New York City, Kanstantsin teaches at a public school and continues to pursue his passion for philosophy and pedagogy through the Svet Peace Project, where he brings together his cross-cultural experience and deep belief in the transformative power of dialogue.</p>

          <p>Amir is an entrepreneur and a senior student at St. John's College. Born in Russia, he began his education at an Orthodox Classical Gymnasium, which sparked his lifelong interest in tradition, dialogue, and the life of ideas. His background spans Eastern Europe, with roots and family ties across several countries in the region.

Before coming to St. John's, Amir studied at UWC Dilijan in Armenia, where he encountered a truly global approach to learning — one grounded in reflection and shared inquiry. Outside of academia, he founded and developed one of Russia's largest vintage clothing stores, which grew into a thriving community around creativity and sustainable fashion. At St. John's, he continues to explore how education can cultivate independence of thought and meaningful understanding rather than rote knowledge.</p>
