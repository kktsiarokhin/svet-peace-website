      <h2>What is the project's idea?</h2>
      <p>At the core of our work is the seminar ‚Äî a free-form, Socratic-style discussion based on great works of literature.</p>

          <h3>Amir B.</h3>
          <p>Amir B. is an experienced entrepreneur, and a current student at St. John's College. Born in Russia, Amir began his education at an Orthodox gymnasium, which laid the foundation for his interest in tradition, dialogue, and ideas. He comes from Eastern Europe, with roots and family connections in several countries across the region. He later attended UWC Dilijan in Armenia, where he encountered transformative approaches to learning grounded in reflection and global engagement. At St. John's, he has deepened his belief that authentic education should foster independent thinking and meaningful inquiry, rather than rely on rote memorization. <strong>Amir B. prefers to remain anonymous in public-facing materials.</strong></p>
