      <h2>What is the project's idea?</h2>
      <p><strong>"SVET Peace Project"</strong> is a comprehensive educational online platform designed to serve learners of all ages. Our core methodology centers on seminar-based learning through structured open discourse. This approach facilitates profound comprehension of literary texts and their fundamental philosophical questions through collaborative dialogue and analytical group engagement.</p>
      <p>Our seminars operate on principles of intellectual equality, where no single voice holds absolute authority. Experienced instructors serve as facilitators, guiding discussions through thoughtful inquiry and encouraging the exploration of diverse perspectives. This collaborative approach enables participants to synthesize their individual insights, fostering a dynamic environment of collective intellectual discovery.</p>
