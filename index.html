      <h2>What is the project's idea?</h2>
      <p><strong>"SVET Peace Project"</strong> is an educational online platform for people of all ages. The central idea of our project is learning in a seminar format (open discussion). Through comprehensive conversation and group work, this method allows for particularly deep understanding of texts and their main questions.</p>
      <p>In our seminars, there is no absolute authority - the ideas of all participants are equally heard. With the help of instructors who moderate discussions through guiding questions and drawing attention to different viewpoints, students unite their thoughts together, creating a unique group intellectual synergy.</p>

          <h3>Amir Balafendiev</h3>
          <p>Born and raised in Russia, in the city of Tolyatti. From early childhood, I was interested in learning about and seeing the world, including through education. After studying at the Orthodox Classical Gymnasium, I went to the international UWC college in Armenia and saw that education can be different, much more interesting and practical. Then, I continued my academic journey and entered St. John's College Santa Fe in the USA, where I understood that education should teach critical thinking, not memorizing correct answers.</p>

          <h3>Kanstantsin Tsiarokhin</h3>
          <p>Grew up in Minsk and Kiev, where I absorbed post-Soviet culture and the spirit of political activism. In Minsk, I began organizing conversational English courses. After 2022, I moved to Berlin, where I immersed myself in German culture and mastered the language. Currently, I am a 4th-year student at St. John's College in the USA, where I study academic philosophy. I also speak Latin and Ancient Greek.</p>
